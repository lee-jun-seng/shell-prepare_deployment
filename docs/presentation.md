# Agenda

## The problem

## Your fix?

## Git?

## How it works?

## All sunshine and rainbows?

## What is next?

# The problem

1. You have a long running project. Lasted many moons.
2. Many changes. Add files, modify files, delete files.
3. Long and slow brew. ‚òïÔ∏è
4. **MULTITASK**!
   - üå∂Ô∏è Hotfixes
   - üì• Concurrent projects
   - üìΩÔ∏è Meetingsssss
   - üìÑ Prepare gazillion proposals/paperworks that eventually ended up in the bin anyway
5. Finally, judgement day.
   - Time to prepare the deployment folder.
6. Ee...?

# Your fix?

# Your fix?

## Documenting

- Well. Document, or, take notes. Obvi.
  - What have been changed? Which files deleted? What are the new files?
  - Document rigorously.
- Still failed? Not documenting enough. Document **HARDER**.

## Blame

- Focus not given. Cannot split brain. Lead/manager's fault.
- Meh.

# Git?

- Wait a minute.
- Git may help you with this.
- Demo time.

# How it works?

1. The script is intended to work with Git local. It is local first method.
1. The shell script will compare the latest state of the branches a.k.a. tip of the branches.
   - This give us the diff.
1. With reference to the diff, it then checkout the branches, and copy the files and prepare it MYwave way.

---

# All sunshine and rainbows?

- Well, not really.
- The script is local first.
  - Without a central repository, you will have to manual sync production codes into `main` branch.
- Branching, merging, squashing, cherry-picking, stashing, resolving conflicts, etc. Git-fu ready?

---

# What is next?

- You can get the script from [GitHub](https://github.com/lee-jun-seng/shell-prepare_deployment).
  - Welcome to fork and contribute.
- You decide if it facilitates your deployment process.
- You may need to tweak your code management process at organisation level.
